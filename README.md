### This project aims to create a decentralized LLM model without filters, in which the community can contribute by providing data for training.

This model will not have any kind of moderation, any data is accepted for training... 

In addition, I will create a cryptocurrency with the aim of being fast and versatile for the most varied applications (games, DeFi apps, NFT, stores).
It will implement a consensus algorithm that will reward contributors to the project in a sustainable and profitable way.

**This project will be purely educational, I don't expect it to become a giant model like Llama or GPT...**
